Welcome! This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experience in web development. It is built using Gatsby, a modern React-based framework for building fast and efficient websites, and Material UI, a popular React UI framework for creating beautiful and responsive user interfaces. A key recent addition is the interactive AI Chatbot (called EVE), designed to provide visitors with a more dynamic and personal way to learn about my work.

## Featured Highlight: The AI Portfolio Chatbot!

I wanted to move beyond static portfolio pages and create a truly interactive experience. Inspired by a desire to integrate AI into my work, I built a custom AI chatbot directly into this site. The core goals were clear: build a chatbot that was **fast, efficient, affordable (ideally free), and intelligent**.

This chatbot allows you to **ask questions about my background, projects, skills, and experience** and receive meaningful, intelligent responses based on my actual portfolio content. It's a technical demonstration that also adds a genuine layer of personality and engagement.

### How It Works (Key Technologies):

Getting this working involved several modern web development and AI concepts:

- **Structured Content:** My portfolio information was organized into a uniform JSON structure and grouped into relational chunks for efficient processing. AI models perform better with concise, organized input.
- **Supabase Backend:** I used Supabase for its **`pgvector` extension** to store vector embeddings and perform fast similarity searches, and its **Edge Functions** for serverless backend logic.
  - An **RPC function (`match_portfolio_content`)** in the database handles similarity search, finding content relevant to your query based on its vector embedding. This significantly speeds up retrieval.
- **Vector Embeddings:** Portfolio content and user queries are converted into numerical "embeddings" where similar meanings are close together. This enables **semantic search**, allowing the chatbot to understand different ways of asking the same question, moving beyond simple keyword matching. The vector dimension must **exactly match** what the AI model outputs and what Supabase expects.
- **Google Gemini:** After encountering issues with Hugging Face (availability, rate limits), I switched to Google Gemini, which was stable and developer-friendly. Gemini generates the final responses based on your query and relevant content found via the similarity search.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE):** To make the experience feel fast and responsive, Gemini's responses are **streamed back to the frontend in real-time** using SSE. This creates a "typing" effect.
- **Frontend (React/Gatsby):** Built with React, the chatbot incorporates performance optimizations like `React.memo` for individual messages, `useCallback` for event handlers, and `useMemo` for the message list to ensure smooth performance. The entire component is also lazy-loaded.

This approach resulted in a solution that is **fast, accurate, cost-effective** (running within free tiers), and low-maintenance.
